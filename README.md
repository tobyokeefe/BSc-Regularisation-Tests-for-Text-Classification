# Regularisation-Tests-for-Mental-Health-Classification

This repository is a product of my undergraduate dissertation titled "The Regularisation of High-Dimensional Data". For reproducibility, this repository contains all the code written to produce results and visualisations within my work. 

The data set, "mental_health.csv" is a collection of texts related to people with anxiety, depression , and other mental health issues containing labels indicating whether the comments are considered "harmful" or not. The data set has been taken from the "Mental Health Corpus" on Kaggle.
